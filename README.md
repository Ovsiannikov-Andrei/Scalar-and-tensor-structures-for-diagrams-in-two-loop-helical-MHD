# Tensor structures for helical terms in two-loop MHD diagrams
* This program is intended for the symbolic calculation of _two-loop_ diagrams in MHD, if you looking for an expression proportional to the helical term.
* All diagrams is completely defined by the Nickel index
* The results are saved in a file: Diagram "Nickel index of the diagram".txt (without any ":" and "|")
* A is a parameter at the vertex Bbv (see line 291). In MHD A = 1.
